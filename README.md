# Game Of Life

## Rules

- **Underpopulation** -> If a living cell has less than 2 neighbours, it dies;  
- **Overpopulation** -> If a living cell has more than 3 neighbours, it dies;  
- **Reproduction** -> If a dead cell has 3 or more neighbours, it comes back from the dead;
- If a living cell has 2 or 3 neighbours, it stays alive.
