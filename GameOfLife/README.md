# Game Of Life

## Rules

- **Underpopulation** -> If a living cell has less than 2 neighbours, it dies;  
- **Overpopulation** -> If a living cell has more than 3 neighbours, it dies;  
- **Normality** -> If a living cell has 2 or 3 neighbours, it stays alive;  
- **Reproduction** -> If a dead cell exactly 3 neighbours, a new one is born in place.
